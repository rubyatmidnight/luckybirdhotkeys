# LuckyBird hotkey script
A set of simple python scripts to custom automate hotkeys for luckybird games without them (tower)



## DEPRECATED FOR NOW

LB updated tower and made it somehow worse, so this will have to be updated.


## USAGE: 

Simply navigate to the folder with python installed, and type `py lbtower.py`. It will give you instructions on how to set your origin mouse point and have you set a few options. These do not save for now (thats next to update a config file etc)


My screen is 1080p, so I set it up with the default offsets with that in mind.


This script uses the `secrets` library, not `random`. So the generated random paths are as secure as they can be for the most part
LB can't learn how you play if you are just playing as randomly as it can be
