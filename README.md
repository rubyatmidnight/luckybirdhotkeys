# LuckyBird hotkey script
A set of simple python scripts to custom automate hotkeys for luckybird games without them (tower)


## USAGE: 

!!! You likely need to adjust the x/y coordinates of the buttons !!! 

To do this, I have also included a mouse coordinate tool, which you can quick check the location of the play button and use that for the base_x and base_y variables.

My screen is 1080p, and I run 1920x1080, and without fullscreening, x = 777 and y = 715 was good enough ((WITH CHAT OPEN!)) It doesn't need to be perfect. 
Without chat open,

Note: This does not automate or bot the game whatsoever, and you still have to play. But it's much faster and easier imo 

Example screen setup on main monitor:

Once that is satisfactory, run the python script `py clicker.py`, and then select the multipler setting (easy, medium, hard, etc). It will accept both 'extreme' or 'expert' for the expert setting, and 'nightmare' or 'master', since the naming differs but they are the same effectively. 

Press L (or any hotkey you change in the script) to click the play button, and then 1/2/3/4 to tap upwards. You must press L/play inbetween every set, it cannot tell if you have lost or won. L/hotkey also hits cash out.

This took me like 10 minutes to get with this, much easier than clicking a lot
